Menelkir Overlay
================

**Attention: Due to a lack of hardware to work on it (HDD and proc to be exact, and right now I can't afford it), so I'm unable to maintain this repository myself (and properly test the packages), but I'm open to receive patches.**

This is a overlay with a bunch of software not available in Gentoo repositories.

If you test with a different keyword and it works, let me know so I update the ebuilds.

There's ebuilds maded by myself and other gathered from the internet and maded
some personal modifications. The follow repositories was used (sorry if I forgot something):
